PI: John VanMeter, PhD 
Goal: Become skilled in the collection and analysis of neuroimaging data
• Collected data for the longitudinal Adolescent Development Study for 135 adolescent subjects and their parents, including:
o MRI scans (structural and functional [attention/interference via Emotional Stroop, risk-taking via Wheel of Fortune gambling task, and impulse control via Go/No-Go task) 
o Neuropsychological assessments (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail-Making Test (TMT), Spatial Working Memory, and Stockings of Cambridge)
o Biological specimens (saliva and blood samples) 
• Operated Siemens Tim Trio 3T MRI scanner for multiple labs and populations including children, adults, and clinical populations (Autism Spectrum Disorder, stroke, MCI, Alzheimer’s Disease, blindness, and epilepsy)

Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC
PI: Andrea Gropman, MD
Goal: Apply neuroimaging research skills to clinical population
• Collected neuroimaging data on individuals age 7 – 60 years with urea cycle disorders (structural, DTI, spectroscopy, and functional [working memory via N-Back and attention/interference via Color Stroop task])
• Administered and scored neuropsychological assessments (Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), Comprehensive Trail-Making Test (CTMT), and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI))
• Preprocessed and analyzed neuroimaging and behavioral data using SPM, LCModel and SPSS

• Conducted an independent literature review on the role of acetylcholine in mediating cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Schizophrenia with the goal of establishing next steps for pharmacological intervention
• Assisted in behavioral testing conducted on mice investigating role of acetylcholine in cognition, including the Morris water maze
• Attended professional development seminars to enhance my knowledge of research ethics and the submission process for IRB and IACUC applications, grant proposals, research ethics, and manuscripts
• Participated in Community Field Experiences including visiting the local crisis centers and psychiatric hospitals for children and adults, attending family drug court for parents being processed through the legal system for drug possession and use, an overnight ride along with a county sheriff, and guest lectures</p>

Temporal Dynamics of Attention and Memory Lab, Iowa State University, Ames, IA
PI: Robert West, PhD
Goal: Gain familiarity with eeg research methodology, data collection, and analysis
• Used event-related brain potentials (ERPs), behavioral, and neuropsychological methods to examine the temporal dynamics of processes underlying cognitive control, prospective memory, and affect in two separate studies investigating gambling and heartbreak
• Dressed the participants with the EEG cap, conducted experiment, debriefed subjects, and analyzed ERPs using EMSE</p>

<p>Research and Administrative Assistant   Jan 2013 - May 2016
Network Community Counseling Center, Iowa State University, Ames, IA
PI: Nathaniel Wade, PhD

• Worked with counselors on scheduling, preparing for sessions, and collecting and processing data</p>

<p>Research Assistant    Oct 2014 - May 2015
Parkinson’s Disorder Research Lab, Iowa State University, Ames, IA
PI: Arthi Kanthasamy, PhD
Goal: Gain understanding of mouse and neuronal cell culture research methods<br />
• Conducted research on cell cultures and mouse models focusing on environmentally, chemically induced neurodegenerative processes capable of producing Parkinson’s disease
• Used N27 cell cultures to test the effects of the insecticide Dieldrin on cell death pathways such as Caspase 3 and 9, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species
• Analyzed cultures using the associated assays and Western blotting</p>

<p>Project Manager   Aug 2015 - May 2016
Project Understanding Stigma, Iowa State University, Ames, IA
PI: Rachel Bitman-Heinrichs, PhD
